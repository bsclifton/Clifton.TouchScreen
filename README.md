# Clifton.TouchScreen
Foundation for ITouchScreenApplication applications. Includes the "Portal" launching program.

This program was originally written in 2007 when I was writing a suite of touch screen applications for my house (using a HUGE 17 inch industrial touch screen monitor) and was ditched when the iPhone / app store became popular.

I recently rediscovered the source code and it could be extremely useful. The portal program will search for DLLs which implement an interface- if found, the code will wire itself up and register itself as a running app.
